/**
 * Pure interception simulator — given an opponent move already in
 * progress and a proposed Ken option, decides whether Ken's attack
 * will physically connect and how much damage Ken takes meanwhile.
 *
 * Scope P2: mono-hit options only (sequence length === 1). Combo
 * chains come in P3.
 *
 * Coordinate conventions
 * ──────────────────────
 *   Ken trajectories are stored as dx / dy offsets + relative boxes
 *   (cx / cy / halfW / halfH) anchored at move start. To project a
 *   sample onto a real Ken position we add (anchorX, anchorY) plus
 *   any facing flip.
 *
 *   The opponent (Ryu) is assumed stationary during his committed
 *   move — true for sweep, cHP, sHP, hadouken startup, etc. We read
 *   his hurtbox at future frames via linear stride walk
 *   (ryuAnimPtr + N * FRAME_STRIDE) — accurate to 1-2f for slow moves
 *   with quasi-linear animation timing, which is the P2 target.
 *
 * Timing model
 * ────────────
 *     t = 0                   — trigger frame (Ken decides now).
 *     t = LATENCY             — input reaches the game (input bus + vblank).
 *     t = LATENCY + startup   — Ken's attackbox is live.
 *     t ∈ [active_start,
 *          active_start+active)— connection window.
